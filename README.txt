= MTik -- A Ruby implementation of the MikroTik RouterOS API

The MTik gem implements the MikroTik RouterOS API for connecting to
devices running RouterOS (with the API enabled) over the network.


== Examples

Included in the examples subdirectory are four example ruby scripts
that use the Ruby API implementation:

tikcli.rb::     A command-line-like API interface
tikcommand.rb:: A tool for executing a single API command from
                a unix command-line
tikfetch.rb::   A tool for instructing devices to download files
                from specified URLs (unix command-line tool)
tikjson.rb::    Like 'command.rb' a tool for executing a single
                API command, except the output is formatted  in
                JSON-style
