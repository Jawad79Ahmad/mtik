= MTik -- A Ruby implementation of the MikroTik RouterOS API

The MTik gem implements the MikroTik RouterOS API for connecting to
devices running RouterOS (with the API enabled) over the network.


== Examples

Included in the bin subdirectory are four example ruby scripts
that use the Ruby API implementation:

tikcli::     A command-line-like API interface
tikcommand:: A tool for executing a single API command from
             a unix command-line
tikfetch::   A tool for instructing devices to download files
             from specified URLs (unix command-line tool)
tikjson::    Like 'tikcommand' a tool for executing a single
             API command, except the output is formatted  in
             JSON-style
